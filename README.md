### 🖇️ Project Structure
Welcome to the Graph Project! Here's how everything fits together:

graph_func.c: This file is where the magic happens! It contains all the graph-related functions you’ll need. Think of it as the engine of the project. 🚀
graph_func.h: This is your guide to the engine—a header file listing all the functions you can call to work with graphs. 📖
graph.c: The brains of the operation. This file contains the main logic or examples that bring the graph functions to life! 🧠
Makefile: Your handy assistant to build and clean the project effortlessly. Just a few commands, and you're good to go! 🛠️
```bash
make              # Compile the program and generate the executable
./myprogram       # Run the compiled program
make clean        # Clean up build files (object files and executable)
```
